## 2.15.22
Created choropleth map for `Applicant_State__Region` data in `SBPD.csv`

# To do:
1. Preprocess the `SBPD.csv` data to correctly categorize data for all states (spelling, capitalization, etc.)
2. Rethink the color scale for the map
3. The acronym for Louisiana should be LA instead of LS but when I changed the spelling it doesnt work anymore.. it's a minor issue but try to fix it
