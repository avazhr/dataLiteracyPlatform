Created choropleth map for `Applicant_State__Region` data in `SBPD.csv` - Ava

### To do:
1. Preprocess the `SBPD.csv` data to correctly categorize data for all states (spelling, capitalization, etc.) - Tarik
2. ~~ Rethink the color scale for the map ~~
3. The acronym for Louisiana should be LA instead of LS but when I changed the spelling it doesnt work anymore.. it's a minor issue but try to fix it - Grace
